            <h2> About this page...</h2>
            <p> Welcome, my name is Lauren, and you have stumbled across my travel blog! Here, you'll find highlights
                from my travels across Asia, Europe, and United States (US). I've been lucky enough to travel a lot
                growing up, and plan on continuing this as I get older. Travels so far have been with friends and
                family, but also my furbaby (solo trip pending)!</p>
            <p>Interested in city life? Living off grid? Sources of adrenaline? or travelling with your pet? If so,
                you're in the right place!</p>

                    <h3>Japan</h3>
                    <p>Japan has always been high on my bucketlist, and this year I was lucky enough to venture over and
                        explore for two weeks! We stuck mainly to the beaten track, in terms of cities, with a
                        sprinkling of nature when we stayed by the base of Mount Fuji. Within cities, particularly
                        Tokyo, the juxtaposition between the old and new is vast, where ancient temples are surrounded
                        by modern bulidings and new technology (futuristic vibes). It is by far one of my favourite
                        places to visit, globally, and will be heading back out there in the near future to explore the
                        breathtaking landscapes.</p>

                    <p>Getting to Japan can be quite expensive, particularly around cherry
                        blossom season. However, the cost of food and transport is more than affordable, with tasty
                        ramens available for Â£5! </p>
                </div>
                <div class="europe col-12 col-md-6">
                    <h3>Europe</h3>
                    <p>Europe has been a go-to travel destination over the past few years, due to the accessibility and
                        affordability, for example, Amsterdam is only an hour or so flight away. There are so many
                        countries to explore, offering different cultures and delights, from tapas in Spain to seeing
                        the Colosseum in Italy.</p>

                    <p>We headed out on a European road trip, starting from Cheshire (United Kingdom) heading all the
                        way to Northern Italy, making our way through France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. It didn't
                        take long for Brett (boyfriend) to adapt on driving on the other side of the road, and unlike
                        the UK, we barely hit any traffic! We did however, have to pay for quite a few tolls, one of
                        which was over 50 euros!

                    <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes, you just want to travel somehere locally.. we're based in England, and make yearly
                        trips to other parts of England, Wales or Scotland (who doesn't love a staycation?!).
                        Staycations provide a perfect opportunity to escape and enjoy the countryside, which is
                        perfect if you want to bring your pup-baby along.</p>

                <div class="united-states col-12 col-md-6">
                    <h3>United States</h3>
                    <p>Considering there are over 50 states to explore, I barely scratched the surface. Starting on
                        the west coast, I headed for San Francisco and enjoyed the city (minus the steep hills),
                        before popping over to Yosemite to visit my very first national park! We headed upwards along
                        the
                        coast towards Oregon, stopping at the Redwood national park. It was a perfect mix of city life
                        and
                        exploring nature. Already planning my next trip over...</p>
